# Super Customer App Development Rules

These rules define the recommended approaches for clean, reusable, and maintainable code in this project.

## 1. Structure and Ownership
- Keep each mini-app isolated under `src/apps/<appName>/` with its own `screens`, `navigation`, and `components`.
- Put shared, cross-app code in `src/general/` only if used by more than one mini-app.
- Do not reference another mini-app’s internal components directly. Share through `src/general/`.
- Keep feature-level screens thin; prefer extracting view logic into reusable components or hooks.
- Screen-level UI components must live under `src/apps/<appName>/components/` (use a feature subfolder like `components/rideOptions/`), not inside `screens/`.

## 2. Reusability First
- Always check if a component is truly app-specific before creating it in a mini-app.
- Prefer composition over duplication: extract repeated UI patterns into `src/general/components/`.
- Use `Text`, `Button`, and `Header` from `src/general/components/` for consistent styling.
- For loading placeholders, reuse `src/general/components/Skeleton.tsx` as the base primitive and compose feature-specific skeleton designs from it instead of duplicating skeleton animation logic.

## 3. Theming and Design Tokens
- All colors must come from `src/general/theme/colors.ts`.
- All typography sizing and font usage must go through `src/general/theme/typography.ts`.
- Access theme values via `useTheme()`; do not hardcode values unless explicitly justified.

## 4. Localization (No Hardcoded Strings)
- Use `expo-localization` for device locale detection and `i18next` + `react-i18next` for translations.
- All user-facing strings must come from localization files (English + French).
- Each app owns its translations under `src/apps/<appName>/localization/`.
- Shared screens and global labels belong in `src/general/localization/`.
- Do not hardcode display text in components, screens, or navigation titles.

## 5. Navigation
- All navigators must live under each app’s `navigation/` folder.
- Top-level routing changes go through `src/general/navigation/SharedNavigator.tsx` and `src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`.
- Avoid passing navigation logic deep into components; use screen-level handlers.
- For modular apps, keep route registration registry-driven (generated files) instead of hardcoding direct app imports in shared layers.

## 6. Type Safety
- Use explicit `Props` types in every component and screen.
- Prefer literal union types for routing decisions (e.g., `'singleVendor' | 'multiVendor'`).
- Avoid `any`. If unavoidable, document why.

## 7. Naming and Consistency
- Filenames should match component names (PascalCase for components and screens).
- Use consistent screen naming (`HomeScreen`, `DetailsScreen`, etc.).
- Keep boolean props named with `is`/`has` prefixes.

## 8. UI Layout and Styling
- Prefer `StyleSheet.create` over inline styles except for small dynamic values.
- Avoid deeply nested layouts; keep component trees shallow.
- Extract complex layout blocks into smaller components.

## Assets
- Store app-specific assets under `src/apps/<appName>/assets/`.
- Store shared assets under `src/general/assets/`.
- Expo app-level assets (icons/splash) stay in `assets/`.
- Avoid placing app-specific assets in shared or global folders.

## Modular Registry Workflow
- `src/apps/registry/app-manifest.json` is the source of truth for enabled apps.
- Registry generation script: `scripts/generate-app-registry.cjs`.
- Generated files:
  - `src/apps/registry/generated/appI18nRegistry.ts` (app ids + i18n resources)
  - `src/apps/registry/generated/appRegistry.ts` (navigation + home widgets + app route types)
- Do not manually edit generated registry files.
- Do not import app internals directly in shared/core files (`src/general/**`, `src/screens/**`).
- Shared i18n files must import from `appI18nRegistry.ts` (lightweight), not `appRegistry.ts` (heavy).
- If adding a new routable app, update `APP_ROUTE_META` in the generator.

## 9. Data, Helpers, and Utils
- Use `src/general/utils/` for shared helpers.
- Avoid embedding mock data directly into screens; use mock data constants where needed.
- Secure storage keys must not start with `@`; use plain namespaced keys instead because `@`-prefixed keys have caused issues in this project.

## 10. Performance Basics
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing expensive components.
- Keep list rendering efficient; use `FlatList` for large data.

## 11. File Hygiene
- Keep files small and focused. If a file grows beyond ~200 lines, consider splitting.
- A component file should contain only one UI component export. Do not add extra component functions or helper methods that also return UI inside the same file; move them into separate files.
- Remove dead code and unused imports promptly.

## 12. Accessibility
- Provide accessible labels on actionable elements when possible.
- Ensure color contrast meets readability standards.

## 13. Tests and Quality
- Prefer unit tests for helpers and UI snapshot tests for stable UI blocks when feasible.
- Keep `package.json` dependencies minimal and intentional.

## 14. Socket Event Conventions
- Do not inline socket event names in screens or feature code. Centralize event names in a typed socket map or app socket wrapper first.
- Keep generic socket clients transport-only. App-specific events belong in app socket files such as `src/apps/rideSharing/socket/rideSharingSocket.ts` and `src/apps/deliveries/socket/deliveriesSocket.ts`.
- Prefer wrapper helpers such as `emitRideSharingEvent(...)`, `subscribeRideSharingEvent(...)`, `emitDeliveriesEvent(...)`, and `subscribeDeliveriesEvent(...)` instead of calling raw `socket.emit(...)` or `socket.on(...)` in screens.
- Reuse the same shared event name and payload type for emit and subscribe so backend contract changes only need to be updated in one place.
- Screen-scoped socket use cases like chat should connect only while the screen is active. Retained keep-alive socket behavior should be reserved for live tracking or other intentionally persistent flows.
- Use structured logging for socket flows and avoid ad hoc `console.log` debugging in production code.
